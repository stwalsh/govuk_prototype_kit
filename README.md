## Nomenclature

* **Smart Answer**: The flow, questions and outcomes.

* **Flow**: Defines the questions, outcomes and the rules for navigating between them.

* **Landing page**: Contains a description of the Smart Answer and the "Start now" button that leads to the first question.

* **Question page**: Contains an individual question that's asked in order to help arrive at at an outcome.

* **Outcome page**: Contains the result of the Smart Answer based on responses to individual questions.
