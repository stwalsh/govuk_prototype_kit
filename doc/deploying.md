# Deploying

## Integration

This happens automatically as a post build action when the [govuk_smart_answers](https://ci.dev.publishing.service.gov.uk/job/govuk_smart_answers/) build passes on CI.

### Manually

If you have sufficient permissions, you can use the [Integration Deploy App](https://deploy.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/job/Deploy_App/). Click the "Build with Parameters" link and enter "release" as the "TAG".

If you do not have sufficient permissions, you can either kick the [main CI build](continuous-integration.md#main) in Jenkins or commit & push something to the `master` branch.

## Production

These are usually done with a Smart Answers developer sitting with someone from 2nd-line Support. You need to prepare and book a production deployment as folows:

### Create the Release in GitHub

#### 1. Find the latest release

Open the [list of releases][smart-answers-releases] and make a note of the name of the most recent release (referred to as `$RELEASE-TAG` below).

##### NOTE. Jenkins and releases

After a successful build of the master branch on Jenkins:

* Jenkins updates the `release` branch to point at HEAD
* Jenkins creates a `release_nnnn` tag pointing at HEAD


#### 2. Review the changes waiting to be deployed to production

Open "https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/compare/deployed-to-production...$RELEASE-TAG".

Open each of the merged Pull Requests that are waiting to be deployed and ensure that the description contains details of the expected changes.


#### 3. Update the latest release on GitHub

Open "https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/releases/tag/$RELEASE-TAG".

Click "Edit release".

Leave the "Release title" blank.

Set the description to:

```
## All included PRs

TODO: List each of the Pull Requests included in the release, for example:

* PR https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/nnn - <title-of-pull-request>

## PRs to check post-deployment

TODO: List each of the Pull Requests that contain user facing changes here, for example:

* PR https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/nnn - <title-of-pull-request>
```

### Create the deployment calendar event

1. Add an event to the "GOVUK Release Calender"

  * Title: "Smart Answers (2nd line required)"
  * Time: <The time you'd like to deploy>
  * Duration: 30 minutes
  * Description: https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/releases/tag/$RELEASE-TAG
