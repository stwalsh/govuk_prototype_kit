# Describing pull requests

Pull requests should contain a link to the Pivotal Tracker story, Trello card or Zendesk ticket that prompted the change to be made.

The description should include a summary of the motivation for the change.

## Factcheck URLs

If the pull request has been deployed to Heroku for factcheck then we should include links to the pages that someone should be checking.

See [PR 2164][pr-2164] for an example.

## Expected changes

If the pull request contains user-visible changes then we should include:

* Links to example pages containing the changes
* Screenshots that highlight the differences before and after the changes

Both of these make it easier to verify that the changes have gone live after a deployment.

See [PR 2164][pr-2164] for an example.
