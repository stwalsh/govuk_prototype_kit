# Regression tests

The project includes a set of regression tests. These tests are not *normally* run as part of the standard build, because they take a long time to run. You can run just the regression tests with the following command:

```bash
$ RUN_REGRESSION_TESTS=true ruby test/regression/smart_answers_regression_test.rb
```

You can run just the regression tests for a single flow using this command:

```bash
$ RUN_REGRESSION_TESTS=<smart-answer-flow-name> ruby test/regression/smart_answers_regression_test.rb
```

Note that the `RUN_REGRESSION_TESTS` environment variable can also be used in conjunction with the rake `test` task if you want to force regression tests to run as part of the standard build.

By default most of the assertions in the regression tests are combined into a single assertion at the end. If you want the regression tests to fail fast then set `ASSERT_EACH_ARTEFACT=true`. However, you should note that this more than doubles the time it takes them to run.

Running the test re-generates a set of HTML/Govspeak files in `test/artefacts` based on the files in `test/data`.

## Test data

* `<smart-answer-flow-name>-questions-and-responses.yml` - defines a set of responses to the flow's questions
* `<smart-answer-flow-name>-responses-and-expected-results.yml` - a record of the question & outcome nodes visited when the above responses are applied combinatorially
* `<smart-answer-flow-name>-files.yml` - checksum data (see below)

## Artefacts

The following artefacts are saved in `test/artefacts`:

* `<smart-answer-flow-name>/<smart-answer-flow-name>.txt` - rendered Govspeak for landing page
* `<smart-answer-flow-name>/<responses-sequence>.html` - rendered HTML for question page
* `<smart-answer-flow-name>/<responses-sequence>.txt` - rendered Govspeak for outcome pages

The `<response-sequence>` is a forward-slash separated list of responses which closely relates to the URL paths to question & outcome pages in the app.

The regression test fails if any of the following is true:

* the newly generated artefact files differ at all from the committed files
* not all nodes are exercised by the test data
* the checksum data is out-of-date (see below)

If you've added extra questions, responses or outcomes, then you should change the `test/data` files to exercise the new paths through the flow. See the instructions for [adding new regression tests](adding-new-regression-tests.md)

If there's a difference in the artefacts, you need to carefully review the changes to the artefacts to make sure they all relate to the changes you have made before committing them.

## Checksums

Checksums for all flow-specific files are stored in a YAML file:

    test/data/<smart-answer-flow-name>-files.yml

Once you're happy that the changes to the artefacts correspond to the changes you intended to make, commit the changes. Then you can update the checksums using the following command:

```bash
$ rails r script/generate-checksums-for-smart-answer.rb <smart-answer-flow-name>
```

When you've resolved all these issues, you should be able to run the regression tests for the flow as before and all the tests should pass:

```bash
$ RUN_REGRESSION_TESTS=<smart-answer-flow-name> ruby test/regression/smart_answers_regression_test.rb
```

## Automatic trigger

The regression test for a given flow is triggered automatically when you run the rake `test` task if you've made changes to any of the files whose checksums are listed in `test/data/<smart-answer-flow-name>-files.yml`. Although this won't always trigger the regression test when it should be run, it covers most common scenarios.

If you've added new classes, modules or data which is used by a flow, you should add the relevant files to the checksums file.

## How to get the regression tests to pass after a code change

This list guides you through the steps you need to take to make the smallest change to a smart-answer, for example changing the text on a landing page.

1. Make the change to the code/template
2. Commit the change
3. Run the [regression tests](#regression-tests)
4. Commit changes to the [test artefacts](#artefacts)
5. Re-run the regression tests
6. Regenerate the [checksums](#checksums)
7. (Optional) Re-run the regression tests
8. Commit the changes to the checksums

Once the regression tests have passed you can prepare your changes for review as usual:

1. Create a [pull request](pull-requests.md)
2. (Optional) Deploy an app to [Heroku](factcheck.md#deploying-to-heroku) for factcheck
  1. Add a "Waiting for factcheck" label to the pull request

## Continuous integration

The [main CI instance](doc/continuous-integration.md#main) and the [corresponding branches one](doc/continuous-integration.md#branches) run the rake `test` task and so work in the same way as above.

We also have a [separate CI instance](doc/continuous-integration.md#regression) which runs **all** the regression tests every so often. This should catch any scenarios missed by the automatic trigger.
