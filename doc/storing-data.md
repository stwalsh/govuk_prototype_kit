# Storing data for later use

You can use the `precalculate`, `next_node_calculation`, `save_input_as` and `calculate` methods to store data for later use. These values are stored in the state and are available in the rest of the flow and in the ERB templates.

* `precalculate` values are available in:
  * The question template
  * The `next_node_calculation` block
  * The `validate` block
  * The `next_node` block
  * The `calculate` block
  * All subsequent questions and outcomes

__NOTE.__ `precalculate` blocks are not evaluated in the first question. This is because they're evaluated during the transition of one question to the next.

* `next_node_calculation` values are available in:
  * The `validate` block
  * The `next_node` block
  * The `calculate` block
  * All subsequent questions and outcomes

* `save_input_as` values are available in:
  * The `calculate` block
  * All subsequent questions and outcomes

* `calculate` values are available in:
  * All subsequent questions and outcomes

The flow below illustrates the data available to the different Question node methods.

```ruby

  option :q1_option

  next_node do
    question :question_2?
  end:

  calculate :q1_calculated_answer do

  end
end

multiple_choice :question_2? do
  option :q2_option

  precalculate :q2_precalculated_answer do
    # responses            => ['q1_option']
    # q1_calculated_answer => 'q1-calculated-answer'

    'q2-precalculated-answer'
  end
