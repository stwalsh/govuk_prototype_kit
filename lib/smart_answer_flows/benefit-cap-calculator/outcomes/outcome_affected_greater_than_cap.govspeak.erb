  Based on the answers you’ve given, you will be affected by the benefit cap as you get £<%= total_benefits %> in benefits and your benefit cap is £<%= benefit_cap %>.
<% end %>

<% content_for :body do %>
  This means your Housing Benefit will now be: £<%= new_housing_benefit %>.

  ##How this is worked out

  The benefits you get are added together. The total amount of benefits over your benefit cap is subtracted from your Housing Benefit:

  Total amount of benefits affected by cap: £<%= total_benefits %>

  Your Housing Benefit is reduced by the amount you are over your benefit cap of £<%= benefit_cap %>:

  Total benefits affected: £<%= total_benefits %>

  Minus benefit cap: £<%= benefit_cap %>

  Total over cap: £<%= total_over_cap %>

  Housing benefit: £<%= housing_benefit_amount %>

  Minus total over cap: £<%= total_over_cap %>

  New Housing Benefit amount: £<%= new_housing_benefit %>

  <% if new_housing_benefit_amount < 0.5 %>
    Your Housing Benefit won’t be reduced to 0. You need to be getting some Housing Benefit to be eligible for other services.
