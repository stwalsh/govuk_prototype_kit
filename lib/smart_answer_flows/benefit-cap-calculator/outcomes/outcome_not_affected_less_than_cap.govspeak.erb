  Based on the answers you’ve given, you won’t be affected by the benefit cap. This is because the total amount of benefits you get are less than the benefit cap.

  ##How this is worked out

  The total amount of your benefits are added together:

  Total amount of benefits affected by cap: £<%= total_benefits %>

  As this amount is lower than your benefit cap of £<%= benefit_cap %>, your benefits won’t change.

  This is an estimate only. Contact the Department for Work and Pensions if you need further help.
