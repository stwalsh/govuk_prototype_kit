  ##How it’s worked out

  Your employee's entitlement is <%= number_of_weeks_entitlement %> weeks.

  They get:

  + 0.5 week’s pay for each full year they were under 22
  + 1 week’s pay for each full year they were 22 or older, but under 41
  + 1.5 week’s pay for each full year they were 41 or older

  Length of service is capped at 20 years and weekly pay at £<%= rate %> (£<%= ni_rate %> In Northern Ireland). Years of service or earnings over these amounts are not included in the calculation.

  The maximum amount of statutory redundancy pay is £<%= max_amount %> (£<%= ni_max_amount %> In Northern Ireland).

  ^Redundancy pay under £30,000 is not taxable.^
