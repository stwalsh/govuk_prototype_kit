  Based on your answers the child maintenance payment is the <%= rate_type_formatted %> rate of £<%= child_maintenance_payment %> per week.

  ^This is the total weekly amount, not the amount per child.^

  The calculator gives an estimate. The exact amount the Child Maintenance Service calculates might be different.
  <% if paying_or_receiving == 'receive' %>
    For example, if the paying parent also supports other children, the amount you receive may be less than this.

  <% if paying_or_receiving == 'pay' %>
    Depending on how child maintenance is arranged, fees may be added to this amount.
