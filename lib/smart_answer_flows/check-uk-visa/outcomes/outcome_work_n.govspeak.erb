  Whether you need a visa depends on your circumstances.

  ## Business visits

  You don't need a visa if you're coming to the UK for activities allowed under the following visas:

  - a [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor-visa) - eg if you’re coming to the UK for conferences, meetings, training, academic research or a sabbatical
  - a [‘permitted paid engagement’](/permitted-paid-engagement-visa) (you must have been invited to the UK because of your expertise) - you can only stay for up to 1 month

  However, you should bring [supporting documents](/government/publications/visitor-visa-guide-to-supporting-documents) to show at the border.

  %You may want to [apply for a visa](/browse/visas-immigration/short-visit-visas) if you have a criminal record or you’ve previously been refused entry into the UK.%
