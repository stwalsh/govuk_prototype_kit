  The remainder of the estate will be shared as follows:

  * the husband, wife or civil partner gets an absolute interest in half of the remainder
  * the other half is then divided equally between the surviving children

  If a son or daughter (or other child where the deceased had a parental role) has already died, their children will inherit in their place.
