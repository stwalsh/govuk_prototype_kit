  Find out if someone can rent your private residential property in England.

  You must check anyone aged 18 or over who pays to use your property as their main home, eg tenants, sub-tenants and paying house guests.

  If you've bought a property that already has tenants, you need proof that their last landlord did the check. Youâ€™ll still be responsible for carrying out [further checks on your tenants](/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents/further-checks) in future.

  ^Read more about the [right to rent documents](/government/publications/right-to-rent-document-checks-a-user-guide) you can accept.^
