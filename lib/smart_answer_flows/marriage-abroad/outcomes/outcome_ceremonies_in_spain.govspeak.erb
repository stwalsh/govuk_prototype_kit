    The process for same-sex marriages in Spain is the same as for opposite-sex civil marriages.

    %There are certain legal restrictions on getting married in Spain if neither of you lives there. If you both live outside Spain, you must check with the [civil registry](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC) where you’re planning to get married to find out if this is allowed.%

  <% end %>

  <%= render partial: 'what_you_need_to_do.govspeak.erb',
      locals: { calculator: calculator } %>

  You'll be asked to provide a [certificate of no impediment (CNI)](/government/publications/example-certificate-of-no-impediment-cni), a [marital status certificate](/government/publications/marital-status-example) or both to prove you’re allowed to marry.

  <% if calculator.resident_of_third_country? %>
    Check with the civil registry  where you’re getting married to find out what certificate you’ll need.

    There are 2 ways you can get these certificates:

    - [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](<%= calculator.outcome_path_when_resident_in_uk %>)
    - [go to <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %> and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](<%= calculator.outcome_path_when_resident_in_ceremony_country %>)

    You need to apply for all certificates at least 3 months before the date you intend to get married.

    You must be physically present in Spain for at least 3 days before you apply for a CNI.

  <% else %>
    ^Document requirements vary across Spain - check with the [civil registry](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC) where you’re getting married to find out what you’ll need.^

    Your partner must also provide their own certificates.

    You must apply for all certificates at least 3 months before you get married.

    ## Getting a certificate of no impediment

    <%= render partial: 'cni_at_local_register_office.govspeak.erb' %>

    Download and fill in the [CNI application pack](/government/publications/uk-cni-pack) - it contains a list of the documents you’ll need.

    Send the documents by registered post to the address in the application pack.

    It takes 10 working days after payment for the consulate to process your application.
