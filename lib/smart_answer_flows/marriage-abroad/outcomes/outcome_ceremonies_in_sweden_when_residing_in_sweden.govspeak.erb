  Contact the [Swedish Tax Authorities](http://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglish/contactus.4.4c5def2714bbf25766d2d6f.html) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

  If you aren’t registered in the Swedish population register you’ll need to provide proof of marital status. A certificate of no impediment (CNI) will be required to prove you’re allowed to marry.

  If you aren’t registered in Sweden, you’ll also need to bring your partner’s extract from the population register as proof of address, or proof of address from the country that you’re living in.

  To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage in Sweden. You can do this at the British embassy.

             } %>

  You can have your [notice of marriage form](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) and [oath or affirmation](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) witnessed in front of a [local notary public](https://www.advokatsamfundet.se/Behover-du-advokat/Sok-advokat/Sokresultat/?areaoflaw=6801) or at the British embassy.

  ###Posting notice at the embassy

  [Book an appointment for a CNI in Stockholm](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-stockholm/certificate-of-no-impediment/slot_picker).

  To give notice of intended marriage at the embassy, you can swear or affirm an oath. If you would like to swear an oath on a holy book (religious), you’ll need to bring your own holy book.

  ##What happens next

  The embassy or notary public can take your oath or affirmation and witness your notice of marriage. The notary public may charge 2 separate fees for this.

  If a notary public witnesses your documents, you must post the signed forms and any supporting documents to the British embassy in Stockholm afterwards, along with the [credit card payment authorisation form](/government/publications/creditdebit-card-payment-authorisation-slip-sweden) to:
