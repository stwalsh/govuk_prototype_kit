    <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %> is an overseas department or territory of France. The rules and requirements for PACS there are similar to France.
  <% end %>

  Contact the [’tribunal d’instance’](http://www.annuaires.justice.gouv.fr/annuaires-12162/annuaire-des-tribunaux-dinstance-21775.html) in the town where you’re entering into a PACS to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

  If you’re not in France, [your closest French embassy](http://www.mfe.org/index.php/Annuaires/Ambassades-et-consulats-francais-a-l-etranger) may also be able to give you advice, or put you in touch with the relevant local authorities.

  ^You should [get legal advice](/government/publications/france-list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

  ##What you need to do

  You may be asked to provide a certificate of custom (‘certificat de coutume’) if you’re entering into a PACS in <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %>.

  You should check with the tribunal d’instance to find out if you need one.

  If you need a certificate of custom, you can get one from the [British Embassy in Paris](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris).

  Some tribunals only accept a certificate of custom dated less than 6 months before the date of your PACS. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.

  ###Applying for a certificate of custom from the British Embassy

  s1. Download the [certificate of custom application form](/government/publications/application-form-for-certificate-of-custom-law-for-pacs-france)
  s2. Make sure you’ve got all of the supporting documents you need - there’s a checklist on the form.
  s3. You’ll need to include a pre-paid self-addressed envelope and a registered letter slip (‘récépissé d’un envoi recommandé sans avis de réception’) with your name and address, or a €6.55 postage fee, if you want your documents to be returned.
  s4. Send your completed form to the British Embassy with your supporting documents and the correct fee. You’ll have to pay in euros, as instructed on the payment slip attached to the form. See fee 11 on [consular fees for France](/government/publications/france-consular-fees) for the current cost.
  s5. The embassy will send your certificate and documents between 5 and 7 days after receiving your application. Certificates are issued in French and don’t need to be legalised.

  ^If you both need a certificate of custom, you can apply together, but each partner must provide a completed application form and supporting documents. You’ll have to pay 2 fees but only one return postage fee.^

  ###The certificate of celibacy

  The tribunal might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not already married or in a civil partnership. It’s not possible to provide this under UK law, so you’ll need to download the explanatory note and take this to the tribunal instead.

  ##Naturalisation of your foreign partner if they move to the UK

  If your partner isn’t British, they can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
