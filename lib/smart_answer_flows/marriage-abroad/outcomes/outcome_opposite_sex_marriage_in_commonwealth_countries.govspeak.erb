    You’ll need to provide the following documents:

    - a statutory declaration made at the local High Court or at the office of a notary public in the UK or Malaysia
    - your original passport and your partner’s passport
    - a divorce certificate (if you have been previously married)

    ^You must get married through an Islamic ceremony in Malaysia if you or your partner is a Muslim. Otherwise, you’ll need to have a civil marriage.^

  <% when 'singapore' %>

      ###Other requirements for Cyprus

      You must provide evidence that you’re allowed to marry if you’re resident in Cyprus but you’ve been there for less than 3 years. However, the [General Register Office](http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/) (GRO) in the UK can only provide letters covering a specified 3-year period, not including the most recent 18 months.

      You should [contact the municipality](http://www.ucm.org.cy/Account_List.aspx) in the area of Cyprus where you’d like to marry to check if they’ll accept this.
