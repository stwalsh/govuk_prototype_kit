    You'll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

    The local registrar may also need a certificate of custom and law, which confirms the marriage is valid - the Embassy in Zagreb can provide this.

    Make an appointment at the local British embassy or consulate to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring the single declaration, your passport, your partner’s passport and pay a fee.

    ^Documents must be originals if you are getting married at the Sharia Court.^
