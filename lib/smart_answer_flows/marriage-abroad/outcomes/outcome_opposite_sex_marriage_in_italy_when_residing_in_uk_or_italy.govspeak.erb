    You’ll need to get a certificate of no impediment (CNI) from the authorities in the UK to prove you’re allowed to marry.

    ###Getting a statutory declaration
    <% if calculator.partner_british? %>


      While you’re waiting for your CNI, you and your partner will need to make a statutory declaration before a [solicitor or public notary](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/) in the UK. The Italian authorities will need this in addition to your CNI. There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.

      ^Your partner should check what they need to do with their own consulate.^

    <% end %>

    ###Legalisation and translation

    You’ll need to get your statutory declaration and CNI ’[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO).

    You’ll also need to get your CNI [translated](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) and sworn before the Italian courts or an Italian Justice of the Peace.

    You’ll be asked to provide a ‘Nulla Osta’ by the authorities in Italy. This is a certificate that proves you’re allowed to marry.

    <% if calculator.resident_of_ceremony_country? %>
      To get a Nulla Osta, you’ll first need to post notice of your intended marriage at the British Embassy in Rome.

                       } %>

      ###Applying for a Nulla Osta

      <%= render partial: "download_and_fill_notice_and_affidavit_but_not_sign.govspeak.erb" %>

      You will need to provide supporting documents, including:

        - your passport
        - your partner’s ID document
        - your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
        - a utility bill, bank statement, official residency certificate, or driving license showing your name and Italian address (if you don’t normally live in <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %> you can show a flight ticket or boarding pass with your date of entry or evidence of your hotel check-in)
        - evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

    <% end %>

    <%= render partial: 'consular_cni_os_not_uk_resident_ceremony_not_germany.govspeak.erb' %>

    You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.


    ^If you’re a woman you must wait 300 days after divorcing or the death of your husband before remarrying.^

    <% if calculator.resident_of_ceremony_country? %>

      ###What happens next

      They’ll display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.

      The British embassy will issue your CNI within 5 working days (as long as nobody has registered an objection). You can collect your CNI in person or have it delivered by post.
