  Make an appointment at the British embassy in Tokyo or British Consulate General in Osaka to swear an affirmation/affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry.

             locals: { calculator: calculator } %>

  You can [download and fill in a form](/government/publications/affidavitaffirmation-of-marital-status-japan) for an ‘Affirmation for marriage’ (non-religious) or an ‘Affidavit for marriage’ (religious) before your appointment. Don’t sign it - you’ll do that at the appointment.

  You’ll need to bring:

  - your UK passport
  - proof of residence showing your current address, such as a residence card
  - your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
  - evidence of parental consent if you’re below the age you can legally get married without consent in the country you’re from (eg 18 in England and Wales)
  - evidence if you’ve changed your name (eg by deed poll)

  ###What happens next

  The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then give you the completed affirmation/affidavit. You should take this to the local authorities where you’re getting married. You’ll need to bring your passport and full birth certificate.
