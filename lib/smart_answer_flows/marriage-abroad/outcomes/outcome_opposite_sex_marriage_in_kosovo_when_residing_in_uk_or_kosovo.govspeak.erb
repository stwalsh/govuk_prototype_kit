    Contact the [Embassy of the Republic of Kosovo in London](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

    ^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %>](/foreign-travel-advice/<%= calculator.ceremony_country %>) before making any plans.^

    ##What you need to do

    You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

    <%= render partial: 'legalise_translate_and_check_with_authorities.govspeak.erb',
               locals: { calculator: calculator } %>

    ^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

    %The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

    You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %>](/government/publications/<%= calculator.ceremony_country %>-consular-fees).

    Contact the relevant local authorities in Kosovo to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

    ##What you need to do

    You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

    To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage in <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %>. You can do this at the British embassy or in front of a notary public.

    [Make an appointment at the embassy in Pristina](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco#!/british-embassy-pristina/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker).

    <%= render partial: "three_day_residency_requirement.govspeak.erb",
                     locals: {
                       country_name_lowercase_prefix: calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix
                     } %>

    You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:


    - your passport
    - your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
    - proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need
    - equivalent documents for your partner

    If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

    - a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
    - a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
    - your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

    You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.

    The embassy will provide you with forms for your notice of marriage, and an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry. You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

    [Download ‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form)

    ##What happens next

    The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.

    %The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

    ##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

    Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
