  You may be asked to swear an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) before you get married. You must do this at a British embassy in Oman.

  You’ll need to complete an [affidavit form](/government/publications/affidavit-form-oman) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

  You can download and fill in (but not sign) the form in advance.

  You must take the form with you to your appointment.

  ##If you can’t have a religious ceremony

  If you can’t get married at a church, mosque or temple, you may be able to get married at the British embassy in Muscat. You and your partner will both need to be resident in Oman and will need to prove that you’re unable to have a religious ceremony. Email <Muscat.Consular@fco.gov.uk> for more information.
