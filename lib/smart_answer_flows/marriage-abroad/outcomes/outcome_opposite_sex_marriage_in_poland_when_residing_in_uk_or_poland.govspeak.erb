  ## What happens next

  <% if calculator.resident_of_ceremony_country? %>
    The embassy or notary public can take your oath or affirmation and witness your notice of marriage. The notary public may charge 2 separate fees for this.

    If you got your documents witnessed at a notary public, you must post the signed forms to the British embassy in Warsaw afterwards.

    There’s an additional fee for this - you must complete a [payment form](/government/publications/credit-card-payment-authorisation-form-poland) and email it to the embassy in Warsaw.

    The embassy will contact you to confirm that the payment was accepted.

  If you’re getting married in a registry office, you must give them your CNI at least one month and one day before your wedding. If you’re getting married in a church, you can do this 2 days before the wedding.

  You will be asked to provide a copy of your birth certificate. Make sure you send a [certified copy](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) as you won’t get it back.
