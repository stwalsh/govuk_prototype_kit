    ##Getting married at the British Embassy

    You can only apply to get married at the British Embassy in Riyadh if you’re resident in Saudi Arabia and neither of you is a Muslim. Contact them to make an appointment.

               } %>
    You’ll need to provide:

    - proof that you’ve been living in the country where you intend to get married for at least 21 days, e.g. an employer’s letter or a bank statement (you’ll also need to sign a declaration to confirm this)
    - your original passport and [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
    - proof that you’re both over the age of 16, not within prohibited degrees of relationship to each other, and there’s no other impediment to your proposed marriage
    - equivalent document for your partner

    If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

    - a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order), or
    - the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

    ###What happens next

    Once you’ve submitted these and paid the registration fee (see below), the embassy or consulate will post your marriage notice publicly for 14 days.

    As long as nobody has registered an objection after this time, the consular officer can then perform the marriage ceremony any time until 3 months after the date you gave notice.

    You’ll need to pay additional fees for the marriage ceremony and to get your marriage certificate (see below).

    You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for <%= calculator.ceremony_country_name %>](/government/publications/<%= calculator.ceremony_country %>-consular-fees).
