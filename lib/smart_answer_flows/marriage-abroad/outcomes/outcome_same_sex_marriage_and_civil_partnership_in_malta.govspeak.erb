  ##What you need to do

  Once you’ve made your appointment, the high commission will give you:

  -  a notice of registration
  -  a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to marry or enter into a civil partnership

  Once you’ve submitted these and paid the registration fee, the high commission will display your notice publicly for 14 days.
