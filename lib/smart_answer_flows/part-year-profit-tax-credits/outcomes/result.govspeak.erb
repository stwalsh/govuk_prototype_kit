  %Your part-year taxable profit is <%= format_money(calculator.award_period_taxable_profit) %>.%

  Use this figure to complete box 2.4 on your award review. Enter £0 if you’ve made or expect to make a loss (your part-year profit is less than £0).

  ^If you have more than one business, you need to calculate the part-year profits from all your businesses and add them together to complete box 2.4.^

  You may be able to [make deductions from this amount](/end-tax-credits-claim/self-employed).

  You’ll have to work out your part-year taxable profit [using the helpsheet](/government/publications/tax-credits-ending-your-award-when-you-claim-universal-credit) that came with your Award Review if:

  - you changed your accounting period part way through the year
  - your profits are based on a longer period or for example, you're a farmer, a foster carer or have foreign income

  ## Your part-year taxable profit has been worked out from:

  Your tax credits award ended on: <%= format_date(calculator.tax_credits_award_ends_on) %>

  <% if calculator.stopped_trading_on %>
    Your business stopped trading on: <%= format_date(calculator.basis_period.ends_on) %>
  <% else %>
    Your business accounts end on: <%= format_date(calculator.basis_period.ends_on) %>
  <% end %>

  Your estimated taxable profit between <%= format_date(calculator.basis_period.begins_on) %> and <%= format_date(calculator.basis_period.ends_on) %> was: <%= format_money(calculator.taxable_profit) %>

  ^You must [keep the records](/self-employed-records/how-long-to-keep-your-records) of your calculation for at least 5 years.^
