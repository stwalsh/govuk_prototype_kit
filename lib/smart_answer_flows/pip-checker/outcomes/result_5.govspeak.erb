  $!Some people in England, Scotland and Wales have already been invited to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP).$!

  If your child is still getting Disability Living Allowance (DLA), when they’ll be invited to claim PIP depends on when their DLA ends.

  You must tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if your child’s care or mobility needs change while they're still getting DLA. They’ll be invited to claim PIP if this happens.

  ###Your child's DLA ends before September 2017

  Your child will normally get a letter before they turn 16 inviting them to apply for PIP.

  ^Contact the [Disability Benefits helpline](/disability-benefits-helpline) if your child's sixteenth birthday is in less than 4 weeks and you haven’t received a letter. Your child's payment may stop if you don’t.^

  ###Your child's DLA ends after September 2017 or DLA awards with no end date

  You can be contacted anytime from 13 July 2015 to claim PIP for your child. This includes if they have a long-term award of DLA or if they have an indefinite award with no end date.

  Not everyone will be contacted to claim PIP right away. Your child will continue to get DLA until DWP writes to you about when it will end.
