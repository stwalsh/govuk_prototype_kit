  ##Cost

             locals: { reg_data_query: reg_data_query } %>

  You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/consular-fees).

  You can order copies of the registration certificate from the British embassy when you register the birth.

  Cheaper copies will be available from the [General Register Office](http://www.gro.gov.uk) in the UK, but not until September the year after you register.

  ##Go to the British embassy

  Book an appointment at the British embassy and bring the registration form, supporting documents and the fee.

  <% if paternity_declaration %>
    The mother must register the birth. If you want the father’s name on the consular birth certificate, both parents will need to swear a paternity declaration in person at the nearest consulate.

    Paternity declarations are free. Contact the consulate for more details.
  <% else %>
    Either parent can register the birth.

  ^Registration can take up to 3 months - your application will be sent to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London where the birth will be registered.^

  Your documents will be returned to the British Embassy in Pyongyang after the birth has been registered. You’ll also be sent copies of the registration certificate if you’ve paid for them. The embassy will contact you when your documents and certificates are ready for collection.
