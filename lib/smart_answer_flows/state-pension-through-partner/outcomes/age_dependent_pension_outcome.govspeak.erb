  You might be able to increase your State Pension depending on when you reach State Pension age.

  ##You reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016

  You may be able to increase your basic State Pension up to <%= higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week if:

  - your own basic State Pension is less than <%= higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week
  - your former spouse or civil partner had enough National Insurance contributions

  If your former spouse or civil partner reached or will reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016, only their National Insurance contributions up to 5 April 2016 can be used.

  ^You won't have received this increase if you were divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved and you remarried or formed a new civil partnership before you reached State Pension age.^

  ##You reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016

  Your State Pension will normally be based on your own National Insurance contributions only.

  Your State Pension may be worked out in a different way if 1 of the following applied before 1977:

  - you paid National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate
  - you chose not to pay Class 2 contributions if you were self-employed

  This is also known as the [married women’s reduced rate election](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni/reducedrate/marriedwomen.htm) (also known as the Married Woman’s Stamp).

  ^Your State Pension may be higher if the reduced rate election applies to you.^

  The Reduced Rate Election must have applied to you at some point within the 35 years before you reached State Pension age (not including the year you reach State Pension age). These must be tax years.

  **Example**

  You’ll reach State Pension age on 6 March 2018. This is in the tax year 6 April 2017 to 5 April 2018.

  You got married in 1975 and chose to to pay National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate.

  Your State Pension will be worked out differently if your reduced rate election still applied to you in 1982.

  ##What you may get if you have a reduced rate election

  You’ll get a pension of about <%= higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week plus any Additional State Pension and Graduated Retirement Benefit you built up before 6 April 2016.

  <%= higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> is the maximum rate of basic State Pension a divorced person who reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016 can get through their spouse or civil partner’s National Insurance record

  You’ll get this when you’re divorced or when you claim your State Pension, if later.

  ^You won’t need to have the minimum of 10 qualifying years on your National Insurance record to get a State Pension if you’re eligible under these different rules.^

  You’ll get more if your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) is higher under your own National Insurance contributions.

  ###If you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age

  You’ll get a pension of about <%= lower_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week plus any Additional State Pension and Graduated Retirement Benefit you built up before 6 April 2016.

  <%= lower_basic_state_pension_rate %> is the maximum rate of basic State Pension a married person or civil partner who reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016 can get through their spouse or civil partner’s National Insurance record

  You'll get more if your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) is higher under your own National Insurance contributions.

  ^Your pension must have been calculated under the reduced rate election rules for this to apply.^

  You’ll get the increase when either you or your new spouse or civil partner reach [State Pension age](/state-pension-age), whichever is later.

  ##Shared additional State Pension or Protected Payment

  The courts may decide to award you a share of your former spouse or civil partner’s [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension/further-information) if one of the following applies:

  - they reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016
  - they reached, or will reach, State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016 and divorce or dissolution proceedings began before 6 April 2016.

  The courts may decide to award you a share of your former spouse or civil partner’s [Protected Payment](/new-state-pension/inheriting-or-increasing-state-pension-from-a-spouse-or-civil-partner) if both the following apply:

  - they reached, or will reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016
  - divorce or dissolution proceedings began on or after 6 April 2016.
