  You can’t increase your State Pension through your spouse or civil partner’s National Insurance contributions.

  The [new State Pension](/new-state-pension) is based on your own National Insurance record.

  ##If you become widowed

  You may be able to inherit some of your spouse or civil partner’s State Pension. What you get depends on when your spouse or civil partner reached or will reach State Pension age and when your marriage or civil partnership began.

  You won’t be able to inherit any of their State Pension if you remarry or form a new civil partnership before State Pension age.

  ##Your spouse or civil partner reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016

  You may be able to inherit a portion of their [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension/further-information) and [State Pension top up](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions/top-up-your-state-pension). You may also be able to inherit half their Graduated Retirement Benefit. This was the earnings-related State Pension people could build up between 1961 and 1975.

  You must have been married or in a civil partnership with your partner before 6 April 2016.

  You may also be able to inherit a portion of your spouse or civil partner’s deferral payment if they had [deferred claiming their State Pension](/deferring-state-pension/tax-and-inheritance) - the date of your marriage or civil partnership doesn't affect this.

  ##Your spouse or civil partner reached or is due to reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016

  You may be able to inherit half of their [Protected Payment](/new-state-pension/inheriting-or-increasing-state-pension-from-a-spouse-or-civil-partner).

  You must have been married or in a civil partnership with your partner before 6 April 2016.

  ###Other benefits you might get

  You might be eligible for a [Bereavement payment](/bereavement-payment), [Widowed Parent’s Allowance](/widowed-parents-allowance), or [Bereavement Allowance](/bereavement-allowance) if you haven’t yet reached State Pension age. You might be eligible for a bereavement payment if you’re over State Pension age but your late spouse or civil partner was not getting any State Pension when they died.

  ##If you get divorced or your civil partnership is dissolved

  The courts may decide to award you a share of your former partner’s Additional State Pension if they reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016. If they reached, or will reach, State Pension age after 6 April 2016, the courts may award you a share of their Protected Payment.
