    <% end %>

    <% if all_uk_students_circumstances.include?('low-income') %>

  <% end %>

  ^Your result is an estimate. Usually, you only get student finance if you’re doing your first higher education qualification - [check if you qualify](/student-finance/eligibilty).^

  ##Extra help

  You could get a [bursary or scholarship](/extra-money-pay-university) from your university or college.

  You might be able to get [help with the costs of travel for study or work placements](/travel-grants-students-england) as part of your course.

  Use the [Turn2us grant search](http://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/) to check whether you qualify for funding from a charitable trust.

  ^Student loans have to be paid back - grants, bursaries and allowances don’t.^
