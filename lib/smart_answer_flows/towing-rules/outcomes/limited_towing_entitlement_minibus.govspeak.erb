  You can already tow trailers up to 750 kg with your D1 minibus licence.

  To tow heavier trailers you need to apply for the provisional D1+E towing with a minibus entitlement and then pass the D1+E test. The total weight of vehicle and trailer can’t be more than 12,000 kg and the fully loaded trailer can’t weigh more than the unladen vehicle.
