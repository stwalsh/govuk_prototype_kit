  Use this tool to find out if you’re old enough or have the right kind of licence to tow a trailer from different kinds of vehicle.

  This tool assumes that you already have the minimum of a full car driving licence (category B). You need a full car licence before being able to tow with any larger vehicle.

  ^A full car licence already lets you tow trailers weighing no more than 750kg. You can also tow heavier trailers with a car as long as the total weight of vehicle and trailer isn’t more than 3,500kg.^
