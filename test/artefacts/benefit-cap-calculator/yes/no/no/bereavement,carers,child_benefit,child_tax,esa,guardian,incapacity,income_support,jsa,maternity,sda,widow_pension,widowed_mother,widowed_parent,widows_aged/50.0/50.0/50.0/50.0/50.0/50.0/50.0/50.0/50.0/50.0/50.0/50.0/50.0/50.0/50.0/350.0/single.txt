Based on the answers you’ve given, you will be affected by the benefit cap as you get £1100.00 in benefits and your benefit cap is £350.00.

This means your Housing Benefit will now be: £0.50.

##How this is worked out

The benefits you get are added together. The total amount of benefits over your benefit cap is subtracted from your Housing Benefit:

Total amount of benefits affected by cap: £1100.00

Your Housing Benefit is reduced by the amount you are over your benefit cap of £350.00:

Total benefits affected: £1100.00

Minus benefit cap: £350.00

Total over cap: £750.00

Housing benefit: £350.00

Minus total over cap: £750.00

New Housing Benefit amount: £0.50

Your Housing Benefit won’t be reduced to 0. You need to be getting some Housing Benefit to be eligible for other services.
