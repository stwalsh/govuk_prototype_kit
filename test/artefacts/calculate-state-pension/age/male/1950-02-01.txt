You’re close to State Pension age. You'll reach it on 1 February 2015.

Your State Pension age is 65 years.

You can now [claim your State Pension](/state-pension/how-to-claim) if you haven't already done so. You need a Government Gateway account to claim online.

Once you claim your State Pension, the Pension Service will work out your full State Pension.

##Pension Credit
You might get [Pension Credit](/pension-credit) if you’re retired and on a low income.

You’ve already reached the Pension Credit qualifying age. Check if you’re eligible to claim [Pension Credit](/pension-credit/eligibility).

##Claiming later
You don’t have to stop working or claim your State Pension when you reach State Pension age.

You can [put off claiming your State Pension](/deferring-state-pension) when you reach State Pension age or take a break from claiming it.

##Voluntary contributions
If you don’t get the full basic State Pension you might still be able to [pay voluntary National Insurance contributions](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions) to fill gaps in your National Insurance record.

You may also be able to top up your Additional State Pension (up to £25 a week) by paying [Class 3A contributions](/state-pension-topup).

##Increase your State Pension based on your partner’s National Insurance record

Check if you can [increase your basic State Pension with your partner’s (or late or former partner’s) National Insurance contributions](/state-pension-through-partner).
