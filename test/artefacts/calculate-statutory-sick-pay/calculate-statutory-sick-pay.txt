Calculate your employee's statutory sick pay

Calculate Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for your employee.

##What you need to know

You’re only responsible for paying SSP if:

- you pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions for your employee (or would do if not for their age or their level of earnings)
- your employee was sick for 4 or more days in a row (including non-working days)
- your employee has told you they’re sick within your own time limit (or 7 days if you don’t have one)

^ You can’t use the calculator for periods of sickness before 6 April 2011.^
