Your employee isn’t entitled to Statutory Sick Pay because they’ve already received the maximum amount of SSP (28 weeks).

You must send them [form SSP1](/employers-sick-pay/eligibility-and-form-ssp1) within 7 days of them going off sick. They may be able to get [Employment Support Allowance (ESA)](/employment-support-allowance).
