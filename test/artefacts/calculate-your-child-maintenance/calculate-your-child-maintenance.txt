Child maintenance calculator


You can use this calculator to estimate your child maintenance. It can help you to:

* agree an amount with the other parent if [you’re arranging it yourselves](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself)
* get an idea of the amount the government would work out for you (including collection and application fees)

Don't use the calculator if you have a ['1993 scheme' or '2003 scheme' case](/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/child-maintenance-before-march-2003). These are managed by the [Child Support Agency](/child-maintenance/contact) (CSA).

^The calculator only gives an estimate - it may not give the right result for complicated circumstances, eg if the paying parent also has children from a different relationship.^

##Before you start

You need information about the income of the parent who'll be paying.

Check the [child maintenance rates](/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/how-the-child-maintenance-service-works-out-child-maintenance) before you use the calculator.

##If your circumstances have changed

If you already have a case with the Child Support Agency (CSA) or the Child Maintenance Service and your circumstances have changed, [contact the office managing your case](/child-maintenance/contact). They’ll tell you if your child maintenance payments will change.
