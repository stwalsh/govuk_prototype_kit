You won't need a visa if your passport has a personal ID number on the bio data page.

However, you should bring the [same documents](/study-visit-visa/documents-you-must-provide) you'd need to apply for a visa, to show to officers at the UK border.

^If the bio data page in your passport doesn't include a personal ID number, you must [apply for a short-term study visa](/study-visit-visa).^
