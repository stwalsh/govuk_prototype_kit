Unfortunately it doesn’t look like you qualify for money off your energy bill.

But you can use a [price comparison site](http://www.beanenergyshopper.com) to check if you can get a better deal.

Smart meters can help you keep track of how much energy you’re using. You won’t get estimated bills and won’t need to take meter readings.

Renewable heating and Microgeneration measures could also help reduce your bill.
See which improvements your property may qualify for.

For some of these schemes further eligibility criteria apply. These can differ depending on your supplier.
