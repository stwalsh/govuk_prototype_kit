The husband, wife or civil partner keeps all the assets (including property) up to Â£450,000, and all the personal possessions, whatever their value.

The husband, wife or civil partner must survive the deceased by at least 28 days to inherit.

They also get half of the amount left over.

The remainder goes to the parents.
