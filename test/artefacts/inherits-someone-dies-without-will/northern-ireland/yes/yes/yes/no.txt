The husband, wife or civil partner keeps all the assets (including property), up to £250,000, and all the personal possessions, whatever their value.

The husband, wife or civil partner must survive the deceased by at least 28 days to inherit.

The remainder of the estate is divided in half between the:

- husband, wife or civil partner
- son or daughter

If the son or daughter has already died, their children (the grandchildren of the deceased) will inherit in their parent’s place.
