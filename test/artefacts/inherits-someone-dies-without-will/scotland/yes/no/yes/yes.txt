The husband, wife or civil partner gets the house up to a value of £473,000. They’ll get a lump sum of £473,000 if the house is worth more, and may have to sell off the property.

They also get:

- up to £89,000 in cash
- a third of the rest of the estate (or the entire estate if the cash sum was less than £89,000)

The rest of the estate is divided in half between any surviving:

- parents
- brothers or sisters

If a brother or sister has already died, their children (nieces or nephews of the deceased) inherit in their place.
