This person can currently rent the property.

You need to make a copy of the [relevant parts of the documents](/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents).

If the tenant's right to stay in the UK is for less than 12 months, check again just before 12 months' time. Otherwise check again just before their right to stay in the UK runs out.

You can read the landlordâ€™s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
