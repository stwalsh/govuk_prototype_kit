##Articles of association
Your articles of association can only be legalised if it has been either:

- signed by an official from the issuing authority
- certified

^A photocopy of your document can be legalised, but it must be certified.^

##Certifying documents

If you provide a certified document, it must be certified in the UK by a solicitor or ‘notary public’.

When the solicitor or notary public signs the document, they must:

- note the type of certification they have done (eg the document is a true copy of the original)
- use their personal signature, not a company signature
- include the date of certification
- include their company address

If they add a notarial certificate, it must be attached to the document. The certificate must also  contain a specific reference to the document they have certified.

If a notary public from England, Wales or Northern Ireland signs a document for legalisation, they must also stamp or emboss the document with their notarial seal.
