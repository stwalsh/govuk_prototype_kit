##Diploma
Your diploma must be issued by an institution that is accredited by either:

- UK Border Agency
- Scottish Qualifications Authority
- OfQual
- British Accreditation Council
- Open and Distance Learning Quality Council
- Association of British Language Schools
- Sport England

It must also be certified, signed and dated by either:

- a solicitor or notary public in the UK
- an official of the British Council (only original certificates)

You may be able to get your document certified at a British embassy. [Check if this service is offered](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/notarial-services) in the country you’re in.

^A photocopy of your document can be legalised, but it must be certified.^

##Certifying documents

If you provide a certified document, it must be certified in the UK by a solicitor or ‘notary public’.

When the solicitor or notary public signs the document, they must:

- note the type of certification they have done (eg the document is a true copy of the original)
- use their personal signature, not a company signature
- include the date of certification
- include their company address

If they add a notarial certificate, it must be attached to the document. The certificate must also  contain a specific reference to the document they have certified.

If a notary public from England, Wales or Northern Ireland signs a document for legalisation, they must also stamp or emboss the document with their notarial seal.
