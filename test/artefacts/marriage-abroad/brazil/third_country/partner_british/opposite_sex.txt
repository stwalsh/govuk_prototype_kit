Marriage in Brazil

Contact the relevant local authorities in Brazil to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Brazil](/foreign-travel-advice/brazil) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Brazil to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee of £55.

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for Brazil](/government/publications/brazil-consular-fees).
