Marriage in Cambodia

Contact the relevant local authorities in Cambodia (the local district office, ‘Sangkat’, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

##What you need to do

If the local authorities say you can get married, you’ll be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Cambodia to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry.

You’ll need to bring your passport, your partner’s passport (or Cambodian ID card) and pay a fee.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation or affidavit as well.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

## What happens next

You’ll need to take the following to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

- your affirmation
- a [certified copy of your passport](/certifying-a-document)
- your [birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
- proof of residence, eg a residence certificate - check with the embassy or consulate for advice

You’ll be asked to provide a criminal record check – check with the embassy how to do this.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue an approval letter which you’ll need to take to the Ministry of Interior. The Ministry of Interior may ask you to complete additional forms and will give you an approval letter.

You’ll need to take the approval letters to your local Sangkat for the marriage registration.
