Getting married abroad

Contact the local authorities in the country where you want to get married or enter into a civil partnership to find out what you need to do.

Your marriage or civil partnership should be recognised in the UK if you follow the correct process according to local law - you won’t need to register it in the UK.

You might be asked to get certain documents from the UK government if you’re a [British national](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/aboutcitizenship/). Use this tool to find out:

- which documents you can get
- how to apply for them

There’s a separate guide if you want to [get married or enter into a civil partnership in the UK](/marriages-civil-partnerships).

%If you’re living abroad and you want to get married in a different country, you’ll need to go to that country to post notice of your marriage. [Read the guidance on posting notice in a third country](/if-you-live-abroad-and-wish-to-marry-in-a-third-country).%
