Marriage in Poland

Contact the relevant local authorities in Poland (the local registry office or church) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

To get a CNI, you must get your documents witnessed in Poland. You can do this at the British embassy or in front of a notary public.

CNIs issued in Poland are valid for 6 months.

You’ll need to have been living in Poland for at least 3 full days before you can post notice, eg if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

### Get your documents witnessed in front of a notary public

Download an [‘Affidavit/Affirmation’](/government/publications/affidavitaffirmation-form-poland) form and a [‘Notice of Marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form-poland) form and take them with you to a notary public.

### Get your documents witnessed at the embassy

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Warsaw.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-warsaw/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)

You’ll need to complete a [‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) form and an [‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- proof of residence, eg flight tickets - check with the embassy or notary public to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.^

## What happens next

The embassy or notary public can take your oath or affirmation and witness your notice of marriage. The notary public may charge 2 separate fees for this.

If you got your documents witnessed at a notary public, you must post the signed forms to the British embassy in Warsaw afterwards.

There’s an additional fee for this - you must complete a [payment form](/government/publications/credit-card-payment-authorisation-form-poland) and email it to the embassy in Warsaw.

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

If you’re getting married in a registry office, you must give them your CNI at least one month and one day before your wedding. If you’re getting married in a church, you can do this 2 days before the wedding.

You will be asked to provide a copy of your birth certificate. Make sure you send a [certified copy](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) as you won’t get it back.
