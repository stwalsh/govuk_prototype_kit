Marriage in Poland

Contact the [Embassy of Poland](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Poland](/foreign-travel-advice/poland) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Contact the local registry office in Poland to find out if they accept UK-issued CNIs. If they don’t, you’ll need to get a locally-issued one.

### Get a UK-issued CNI

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in [England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/register-offices), [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in Poland to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

### Get a locally-issued CNI

If the local registry office in Poland doesn’t accept UK-issued CNIs, you must make an appointment at the British embassy in Warsaw to get a locally-issued CNI.

### Legalisation and translation

You must check with the local authorities in Poland to see if your UK-issued CNI needs to be:

- ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine)
- translated - [find a translator abroad](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.ciol.org.uk)

You should also check with the local authorities in Poland to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

## What happens next

If you’re getting married in a registry office, you must give them your CNI at least one month and one day before your wedding. If you’re getting married in a church, you can do this 2 days before the wedding.

You will be asked to provide a copy of your birth certificate. Make sure you send a [certified copy](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) as you won’t get it back.

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for Poland](/government/publications/poland-consular-fees).

You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.
