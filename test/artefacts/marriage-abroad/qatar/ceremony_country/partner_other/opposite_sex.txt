Marriage in Qatar


Contact the relevant local authorities in Qatar to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^There are no civil marriages in Qatar, but you can get married through a religious ceremony at a church or Sharia court.^

You may be able to get married at the British Embassy if you’re both resident in Qatar and can prove that there are no other suitable facilities to get married locally.

Contact the British Embassy in Qatar for more information.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You need to have been living in Qatar for 21 days.

You’ll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Qatar to swear an affirmation or affidavit that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
