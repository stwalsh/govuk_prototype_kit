Marriage in Slovenia

Contact the relevant local authorities in Slovenia to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Slovenia to swear an affirmation or affidavit that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Ljubljana.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-ljubljana/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)

You’ll need to complete an [affidavit form](/government/publications/affidavit-form-slovenia) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the form in advance.

You must take the form with you to your appointment.

^Your partner will need to get an affirmation as well.^

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.^

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%
