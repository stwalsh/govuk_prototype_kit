Marriage in South Africa


Contact the [relevant local authorities](http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/civic-services/marriage-certificates) in South Africa to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for South Africa](/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa) before making any plans.^

The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNIs) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. The British High Commission in Pretoria or the Consulate General in Cape Town can provide a letter to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Contact the High Commission and Consulate General to arrange to collect a letter.
