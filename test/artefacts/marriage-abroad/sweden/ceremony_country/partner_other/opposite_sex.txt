Marriage in Sweden

Contact the [Swedish Tax Authorities](http://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglish/contactus.4.4c5def2714bbf25766d2d6f.html) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

If you aren’t registered in the Swedish population register you’ll need to provide proof of marital status. A certificate of no impediment (CNI) will be required to prove you’re allowed to marry.

If you aren’t registered in Sweden, you’ll also need to bring your partner’s extract from the population register as proof of address, or proof of address from the country that you’re living in.

To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage in Sweden. You can do this at the British embassy.

You’ll need to have been living in Sweden for at least 3 full days before you can post notice, eg if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

You can have your [notice of marriage form](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) and [oath or affirmation](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) witnessed in front of a [local notary public](https://www.advokatsamfundet.se/Behover-du-advokat/Sok-advokat/Sokresultat/?areaoflaw=6801) or at the British embassy.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

###Posting notice at the embassy

[Book an appointment for a CNI in Stockholm](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-stockholm/certificate-of-no-impediment/slot_picker).

To give notice of intended marriage at the embassy, you can swear or affirm an oath. If you would like to swear an oath on a holy book (religious), you’ll need to bring your own holy book.

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner

You’ll also need the correct fees.

You’ll need to complete a [‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) form and an [‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.^

##What happens next

The embassy or notary public can take your oath or affirmation and witness your notice of marriage. The notary public may charge 2 separate fees for this.

If a notary public witnesses your documents, you must post the signed forms and any supporting documents to the British embassy in Stockholm afterwards, along with the [credit card payment authorisation form](/government/publications/creditdebit-card-payment-authorisation-slip-sweden) to:

$A
British Embassy
Consular Section
Box 27819
115 93 Stockholm
$A

^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^
