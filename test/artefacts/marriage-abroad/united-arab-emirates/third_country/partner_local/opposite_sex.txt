Marriage in the United Arab Emirates


Contact the relevant local authorities in the United Arab Emirates to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for the United Arab Emirates](/foreign-travel-advice/united-arab-emirates) before making any plans.

^There are no civil marriages in the United Arab Emirates, but you can get married through a religious ceremony at a church or Sharia court.^

You can only get married in the United Arab Emirates if you or your partner are resident there.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in the United Arab Emirates to swear an affirmation or affidavit that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

^If you have dual nationality and you entered the United Arab Emirates on a non-British passport, you must contact the embassy of that country to get your affirmation or affidavit.^

You’ll need to complete an  [‘Affirmation for marriage’ (non-religious) or an ‘Affidavit for marriage’ (religious) form](/government/publications/affidavitaffirmatin-of-marital-status-forms-uae) in English.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the form in advance.

^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation or affidavit as well.^

### What you need to take

You’ll need to take all of the following to your appointment:

- your completed and typed affirmation or affidavit – you’ll be sent the form by email after booking your appointment
- your passport and UAE residency or entry visa
- the residency visa/UAE entry stamp in your partner’s passport if they’re resident in the United Arab Emirates
- a copy of your partner’s passport or ID if they aren’t resident in the United Arab Emirates

^A marriage affirmation or affidavit is valid for 3 months.^

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
