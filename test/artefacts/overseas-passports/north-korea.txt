You canâ€™t apply for a British passport from North Korea.

You can apply in a neighbouring country of your choice - pick one from the [list of countries](/overseas-passports/y) and follow the application process for that country.

If you need help with emergency travel arrangements in North Korea, contact the [British Embassy in Pyongyang](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-pyonyang).
