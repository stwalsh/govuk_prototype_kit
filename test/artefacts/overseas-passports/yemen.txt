You canâ€™t apply for a British passport from Yemen.

You can apply in a neighbouring country of your choice - pick one from the [list of countries](/overseas-passports/y) and follow the application process for that country.

If you need more information read the [Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/yemen).
