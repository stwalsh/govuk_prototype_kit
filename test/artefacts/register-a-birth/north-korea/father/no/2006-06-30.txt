$!You must register the birth according to the regulations in North Korea.$!

You can’t usually register your child’s birth with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Overseas Registration Unit. This is because unmarried fathers can’t pass on British nationality to a child born before 1 July 2006.

You may still be able to apply for [British citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/citizenship) for the child.

You may however be able to register the birth if either:

- you’ve married the other parent since the child was born (depending on the father's [legal country of domicile](/government/publications/legitimation-and-domicile) at the time of the birth)
- the country where the father was [legally domiciled](/government/publications/legitimation-and-domicile) at the time of the birth did not distinguish between married and unmarried parents
