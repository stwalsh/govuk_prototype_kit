Register a birth abroad

$!You must register your child’s birth according to the regulations in the country where the child was born. They’ll give you a local birth certificate.$!

This local birth certificate should be accepted in the UK, eg when you apply for a passport or register with a school or doctor. You might need to have it [translated and certified](https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document) if it isn’t in English.

Once you’ve registered locally you may also be able to register the birth with the UK authorities. You can only do this if the child was born on or after 1 January 1983.

You don’t need to register with the UK authorities but it means:

- the birth will be recorded with the General Register Offices or at the National Records Office of Scotland
- you can order a consular birth registration certificate

^You can still [apply for a UK passport for your child](/apply-renew-passport) even if you don’t register the birth in the UK.^
