You should register the death within 5 days.

You can go to any [register office](/register-offices) but if you use the one in the area where the person died you’ll be given the documents you’ll need on the day.

If you use a different register office the documents will be sent to the office in the area where the person died before they’re issued to you. This means you’ll usually wait a few days.

^Registering the death will take about 30 minutes - you might need to make an appointment.^

Who can register the death
--------

You can register the death if you’re:

- a relative
- someone present at the death
- an administrator from the hospital
- the person making arrangements with the funeral directors

What you need to do
--------

Take the medical certificate showing the cause of death (signed by a doctor) with you.

If the cause of death is unknown, sudden or unexplained it may be reported to the coroner.

The coroner will give you the documents you need, or they’ll send them direct to the registrar. The table below shows the documents needed.

Cause of death | Documents issued by coroner
- | -
Natural causes | Form 100A, or Pink Form 100B if there's a post-mortem - these forms are sent to the  registrar, but sometimes given to you
Unnatural causes/not enough evidence of natural causes | Order for Burial (form 101) or Certificate for Cremation (form 6) so the funeral can take place – will be given to you; Certificate After Inquest (form 99 (rev)) - this states the cause of death and is sent to the registrar (the death is registered by the registrar with no-one present)

###If form 100A or 100B is issued (ie there is no inquest)

If available (but don't worry if not), also take the person’s:

- birth certificate
- marriage or civil partnership certificate
- NHS medical card

You’ll need to tell the registrar:

- the person’s full name at the time of death
- any names previously used, eg maiden name
- the person’s date and place of birth
- their last address
- their occupation
- the full name, date of birth and occupation of a surviving or late spouse or civil partner
- whether they were getting a State Pension or any other benefits

You should also take supporting documents that show your name and address (eg a utility bill) but you can still register a death without them.

Documents you’ll get
--------

When you register a death you’ll get a Certificate of Registration of Death (form BD8). You may need to fill this out and return it if the person was getting a State Pension or benefits (the form will come with a pre-paid envelope so you know where to send it).

You can buy extra death certificates - these will be needed for [sorting out the person’s affairs](/after-a-death/overview).
