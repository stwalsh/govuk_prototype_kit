You should [register the death locally in Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/death-and-bereavement/death-and-bereavement-what-to-do-when-someone-dies/registering-a-death.htm).

If the body’s being brought back to England or Wales to be buried or cremated, the person bringing the body back must report this to the local registrar. They will issue a ‘Certificate of No Liability to Register’.
