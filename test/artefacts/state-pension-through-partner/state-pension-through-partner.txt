Your partner’s National Insurance record and your State Pension

People who reach [State Pension age](/state-pension-age) on or after 6 April 2016 will claim the new State Pension.

People who reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016 will continue to get their State Pension under the old State Pension system (which includes [basic State Pension](/state-pension) and [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension)  and Graduated Retirement Benefit).

The rules for how you can increase your State Pension and what you can inherit will be different depending on when you and your spouse or civil partner reach [State Pension age](/state-pension-age).

You’ll need to know when both you and your spouse or civil partner reach State Pension age to use this tool.
