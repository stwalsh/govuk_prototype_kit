Your State Pension will normally be based on your own National Insurance contributions only.

Your State Pension may be worked out in a different way if 1 of the following applied before 1977:

- you paid National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate
- you chose not to pay Class 2 contributions if you were self-employed

This is also known as the [married women’s reduced rate election](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni/reducedrate/marriedwomen.htm) (also known as the Married Woman’s Stamp).

^Your State Pension may be higher if the reduced rate election applies to you.^

The Reduced Rate Election must have applied to you at some point within the 35 years before you reached State Pension age (not including the year you reach State Pension age). These must be tax years.

**Example**

You’ll reach State Pension age on 6 March 2018. This is in the tax year 6 April 2017 to 5 April 2018.

You got married in 1975 and chose to to pay National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate.

Your State Pension will be worked out differently if your reduced rate election still applied to you in 1982.

###If you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age

You’ll get a pension of about £67.80 a week plus any Additional State Pension and Graduated Retirement Benefit you built up before 6 April 2016.
