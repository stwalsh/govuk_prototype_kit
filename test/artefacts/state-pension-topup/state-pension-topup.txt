State Pension top up calculator

Until 5 April 2017 you’ll be able to apply to make a ‘Class 3A voluntary contribution’ to top up your State Pension by up to £25 per week.

Calculate how much you’ll need to contribute. You must be [entitled to the State Pension](/state-pension/eligibility) and either:

- a man born before 6 April 1951
- a woman born before 6 April 1953


###What you need to know

You can choose to top up your State Pension by between £1 and £25 per week. How much you’ll need to contribute depends on:

- how much extra pension you want to get each week
- how old you are when you make the contribution

**Example**
You are 68 years old in October 2015. You decide that you want to get an extra £5 per week (£260 a year) on top of your pension.

The cost of an extra £1 per week for a 68 year old is £827, so you multiply £827 by 5.

You’ll make a lump sum payment of £4,135.
