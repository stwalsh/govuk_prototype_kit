You already have a restricted C1+E towing with a medium-sized vehicle entitlement on your licence.

This means you can tow trailers weighing more than 750 kg. The total weight of the vehicle and trailer can’t be more than 8,250 kg and the fully-loaded trailer can’t weigh more than the unladen vehicle weight.
