You can tow trailers up to 750 kg with a standard C1 medium-sized vehicle licence as long as the vehicle weight isn’t more than 7,500 kg.

If you want to tow heavier trailers you’ll need to pass the C1+E test.

This lets you have a restricted C1+E entitlement because you’re under 21. It lets you tow trailers heavier than 750 kg as long as the combined vehicle and trailer weight isn’t more than 7,500 kg.

Once you’re 21 you’ll automatically get the full C1+E entitlement and you can tow combinations up to 12,000 kg. The fully-loaded trailer can’t weigh more than the unladen vehicle.
