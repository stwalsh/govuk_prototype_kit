You can export bereavement benefits to Bosnia And Herzegovina although you won't get any annual increases after you've moved there.

Claim [Bereavement Allowance](/bereavement-allowance/how-to-claim), [Bereavement Payment](/bereavement-payment#how-to-claim) or [Widowed Parent's Allowance](/widowed-parents-allowance#how-to-claim) before leaving the UK.

Once you have claimed bereavement benefits, [contact the International Pension Centre](/international-pension-centre) to find out if you can export them.
