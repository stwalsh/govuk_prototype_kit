You may be able to carry on getting [Income Support](/income-support) for up to 8 weeks if your child is receiving medical treatment.

You can't get Income Support while you're abroad if you're going for treatment for yourself.

There is no 8 week limit for NHS-funded treatment abroad for either you or your child.

Tell your local [Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus) before you go.
