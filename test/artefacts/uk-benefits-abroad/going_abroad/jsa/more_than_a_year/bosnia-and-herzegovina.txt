You can't get JSA while you're abroad. Your [UK National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance) may help you qualify for unemployment benefits because of the UK's social security agreements with Bosnia And Herzegovina.

Ask the authorities in Bosnia And Herzegovina about any benefits you might be entitled to.

*[JSA]: Jobseeker's Allowance
