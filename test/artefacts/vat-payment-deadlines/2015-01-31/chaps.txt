Paying by CHAPS

The last date you can pay is 6 March 2015.

HMRC must receive the money by 6 March 2015.

You need your VAT registration number as the payment reference.

CHAPS payments usually reach HMRC the same working day if you pay within your bank’s processing times.

^Check your bank’s transaction limits and processing times before making a payment.^
