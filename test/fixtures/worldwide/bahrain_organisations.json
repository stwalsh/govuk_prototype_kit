Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible. Sometimes however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions. In these situations we will endeavour to provide a service or access to a building in an alternative way to ensure equality of access for disabled people. To assist disabled visitors, we have set out below details of disabled access at this Embassy. We hope this information is helpful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-physical-access\">General physical access</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Entrance to the Main Reception is clear, unobstructed and at ground level with no impediments.</li>\n  <li>Toilet facilities for public users can be found in Consular Section when approaching the main reception.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"contact-us\">Contact us</h3>\n\n<p>If you need to visit us or use our services and feel that they may be inaccessible to you, please contact Mrs. Gaby Melvin (Tel: 17574100) who will try to find an alternative way of providing access for you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"location-and-access\">Location and access</h2>\n\n<p>Information for visitors to the British Embassy</p>\n\n<p>Visitors to the British Embassy Bahrain will be subject to security procedures on arrival.
