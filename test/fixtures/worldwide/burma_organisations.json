Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible.  Sometimes however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions.  In these situations we will endeavour to provide a service or access to a building in an alternative way to ensure equality of access for disabled people.  To assist disabled visitors, we have set out below details of access for the disabled at this Embassy.  We hope this information is helpful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-physical-access\">General physical access</h3>\n<p>Access to the Embassy building is constrained by security considerations and the current layout of access routes and facilities.  However, reception and security staff are alert to the requirements of disabled visitors and will endeavor to ensure that disable visitors are provided with appropriate assistance during their visit to ensure that they have access to Embassy services.</p>\n\n<p>If you anticipate requiring assistance, please telephone in advance of your visit so that we can ensure that we are able to provide access for you: </p>\n\n<p>Telephone: +95 (1)370863 and ask for the Security Manager or </p>\n\n<p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:Management.Rangoon@fco.gov.uk\">Management.Rangoon@fco.gov.uk</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-holidays\">Public holidays</h2>\n<p>The Embassy will observe the following public holidays during 2016.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>New Year’s Day\t\t\t            1 January\tFriday</li>\n  <li>Independence Day\t\t\t\t4 January\tMonday</li>\n  <li>Union Day\t\t\t\t           12 February\tFriday</li>\n  <li>Good Friday\t\t\t\t           25 March\tFriday</li>\n  <li>Easter Monday\t\t\t           28 March\tMonday\t\t\t</li>\n  <li>Thingyan Water Festival\t\t           11 April\tMonday</li>\n  <li>Thingyan Water Festival\t\t           12 April\tTuesday</li>\n  <li>Thingyan Water Festival\t\t           13 April\tWednesday</li>\n  <li>Thingyan Water Festival\t\t           14 April\tThursday</li>\n  <li>Thingyan Water Festival\t\t           15 April\tFriday</li>\n  <li>Early May Bank Holiday\t\t             2 May\t\tMonday</li>\n  <li>Martyr’s day\t\t\t\t           19 July\t\tTuesday</li>\n  <li>Summer Bank Holiday\t\t           29 August\tMonday</li>\n  <li>In lieu for Christmas Day\t\t           26 December \tMonday\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Embassy will remain open on the following public holidays: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Peasant Day \t\t\t\t\t2 March\tWednesday</li>\n  <li>Full Moon Day of Tabaung\t\t          23 March\tWednesday</li>\n  <li>Full Moon Day of Tazaungmone\t          14 November\tMonday\t</li>\n  <li>National Day\t\t\t\t          24 November\tThursday\t</li>\n  <li>Kayin New Year Day\t\t\t          29 December\tThursday</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
