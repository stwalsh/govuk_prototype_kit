While we aim for this to be as light-touch as possible, it does require a search of bags and pockets.\nThe British Embassy in Dakar security regulations, in line with all British Diplomatic Missions world-wide, do not permit visitors to enter the embassy with mobile telephones, laptops, PDAs or any other similar electrical devices. We prefer that you arrive at the Embassy without them. If this is not possible we can retain them at the entrance during your visit. </p>\n\n<p>Weapons (including pepper sprays), or any object that our Security Staff consider could be used as a weapon, are also forbidden. These will not be retained by our staff. Should you arrive with such an object you will not be granted access but will be asked to return without it.</p>\n\n<p>These regulations are intended to help us ensure the security for our staff and visitors. Your cooperation is appreciated.</p>\n\n</div>",
