While we aim for this to be as light-touch as possible, it may require a search of bags and pockets.</p>\n\n<p>Security regulations at the British Embassy in San José, in line with all British Diplomatic Missions worldwide, do not permit visitors to enter the Embassy with mobile telephones, laptops, PDAs or any other similar electrical devices. We prefer that you arrive at the embassy without them. If this is not possible the building security will retain them at the entrance for the duration of your visit.</p>\n\n<p>Weapons (including pepper sprays), or any object that the security staff consider could be used as a weapon (scissors, screwdrivers, small blades), are also forbidden. These will not be retained by security. Should you arrive with such an object, you will not be granted access but will be asked to return without it.</p>\n\n<p>These regulations are intended to help us ensure the security for our staff and visitors. Your cooperation is appreciated.</p>\n</div>",
