Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible. Sometimes however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions. In Pretoria, the High Commission is located in protected premises at 255 Hill Street (between Schoeman and Pretorius street) with the main entry for visitors being accessed from Hill Street. Access is controlled by security staff and all visitors are required to be cleared by security before being allowed access into the High Commission building. To assist disabled visitors, we have set out below details of disabled access at this High Commission. We hope this information is helpful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-physical-access\">General physical access</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Entrances: there is one easy access available into the main High Commission building and prior notification is desirable</li>\n  <li>Toilets: there are toilet facilities which can accommodate wheelchairs</li>\n  <li>Floor coverings, doorways, and handles are of standard design</li>\n  <li>The entrance area is well lit</li>\n  <li>Emergency/evacuation: evacuation is on foot leading to most of the exit points.
