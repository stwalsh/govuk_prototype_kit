The British Office Taipei is housed on the 26th floor of a 30-storey building. The building management has installed ramps giving wheelchair users access to the building from the main street.</p>\n\n<p>Once inside the building, all visitors must obtain an access card which allows them to use the lifts. These are obtainable from dedicated terminals to the left of the main entrance. Visitors should use the terminals to call the British Office Taipei receptionist who will authorise the terminal to issue a card. If, as a disabled visitor, you have difficulty using the terminals, please approach the building security or reception for assistance. Alternatively, telephone the British Office Taipei reception at 02 8758 2088 for help.</p>\n\n<p>There are no internal steps in our offices and there is wide access for visitors to our Visa Section. There is a lavatory for disabled users inside the British Office Taipei.</p>\n\n<p>In emergencies, disabled visitors may either be evacuated by the fire brigade from the 26 floor or helped evacuate by members of staff to using the specially made transit chair down the emergency stairs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-us\">Contact us</h2>\n\n<p>If you need to visit us or feel that you may have accessibility difficulties, please contact the Corporate Services Section on 02 8758 2088 for assistance.</p>\n\n<p>For consular enquiries, please email to <a href=\"mailto:Bass.Taipei@fco.gov.uk\">British Assistance and Services Section</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that many of our services (including visas) are available online through our website.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-holidays\">2016 Public holidays</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>1 January – New Year’s Day</li>\n  <li>8-11 February – Lunar New Year</li>\n  <li>29 February – 228 Peace Memorial Day</li>\n  <li>25 March – Good Friday</li>\n  <li>28 March – Easter Monday</li>\n  <li>4 April – Children’s Day/Tomb Sweeping Day</li>\n  <li>10 June – Dragon Boat Festival</li>\n  <li>16 September – Mid-Autumn Festival</li>\n  <li>10 October – Taiwanese National Day</li>\n  <li>26- 27 December – Christmas Holiday/ Boxing Day</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
