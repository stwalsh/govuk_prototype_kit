Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible. Sometimes, however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions. In these situations we will endeavour to provide a service or access to a building in an alternative way to ensure equality of access for disabled people. To assist disabled staff and visitors, we have set out below details of disabled access at the Embassy. We hope this information is helpful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-physical-access\">General Physical Access</h3>\n<p>There is a disabled access through the pedestrian entrance.  If you require assistance, please telephone us in advance of your visit so that we can ensure that we are able to provide access for you and allow your vehicle access to the Embassy Compound (Please call +62 (021) 2356 5200 and ask for the Deputy Security Manager).
