Sometimes however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions. In these situations we will endeavour to provide a service or access to a building in an alternative way to ensure equality of access for disabled people. For example, the guards at the main entrance of the British High Commission in Lusaka can arrange for the interconnecting gates to be unlocked to allow access for disabled people to the main British High Commission reception area.</p>\n\n<p>To assist disabled visitors, we have set out below details of disabled access at this High Commission. We hope this information is helpful.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"general-physical-access\">General physical access:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>entrances - all entrances have ramps and are accessible to wheelchairs </li>\n  <li>steps and staircases - none of the stairs have clear step edging or anti slip edging </li>\n  <li>stairs - all of the High Commission’s services can be offered on the ground floor </li>\n  <li>toilets - separate toilets that can accommodate wheelchairs are available </li>\n  <li>parking - parking spaces are available outside of the High Commission at owners’ risk, however, no transfer space for wheelchairs is \navailable.
